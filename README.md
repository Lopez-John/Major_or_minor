# Major_or_minor
Personal project to freshen up my Machine learning and Neural network skills, while also learning new skills, such as .wav file processing and implementing user file inputs using flask

Goals
------
The app should allow a user to input a .wav file of a chord and have return whether the chord is in a Major key or minor key
The app will implement a classification Neural Network
