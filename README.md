# Major_or_minor
Personal project to freshen up my Machine learning and Neural network skills, while also learning new skills, such as .wav file processing and implementing user file inputs using flask

Goals
------
The app should allow a user to input a .wav file of a chord and have return whether the chord is in a Major key or minor key

To do so, the app will implement a classification Neural Network to determine Major or Minor key.

The Neural network will also beat the Accuracy rating of a Random Forest Classifier I created to make the same classification

Technologies
-----------
Python 3.9
Numpy
Librosa
matplotlib
